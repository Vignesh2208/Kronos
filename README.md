Kronos: A high precision virtual time system based on instruction counting

Full documentation can be found [here](https://kronoz.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html).
	
New in version 1.3: An update involing instruction counting based on Intel-PIN-TOOL is included in version 1.3
See examples/example_app_vt_experiment.py file where app_vt_tracer binaries are started (instead of the the
traditional tracer binaries). These app_vt_tracers rely on INTEL-PIN-TOOLs for instruction counting.
